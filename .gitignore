# raytracing precomputation example in WebGL 2.0
### Controls:
`1` - enter real-time mode

`2` - enter precomputation mode

`i/o` - Using raytracing precomputed texture off/on

`P` while in precomputation (`2`) mode - save texture to fille

`drag'n'drop` file to app - load texture from file

### Try it yourself!
When you open the app, simple (1 bounce) real time lighting is used.
Next, press `2` to switch to the precomputation mode, wait about 1 minute and press `1` to return back.
Now you can press `o` and enable using precomputed luminance information from texture!
